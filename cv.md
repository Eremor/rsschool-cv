## Summary
My main goal is to change professional activities. At the moment, I work as a systems engineer and I understand that I have come to the point where I do not have enough current work intellectually, therefore, I began to actively study programming. For these purposes, I try to allocate as much time as possible and "absorb" the information with great zeal.
